In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial markets have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and uncertainty. This project aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. securities market, focusing on the period from different dates. By analyzing historical data on various market indicators such as volatility, bid-ask spreads, dollar volume, and returns, alongside employing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, this study seeks to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships that shaped market behavior during this critical juncture. 
The financial markets, especially those impacted by regulatory changes like the SEC Tick Size Pilot program, require rigorous analysis to understand their effects on market dynamics. This project delves into the aftermath of the SEC Tick Size Pilot program, aiming to discern its influence on the bid-ask spread of securities. Utilizing monthly data from the Stock_data_part3.xlsx and a curated list of treatment and control securities, this study employs a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to evaluate the program's impact. The objective is to provide actionable insights for asset management firms like AQR, enabling them to adjust their trading strategies to minimize transaction costs effectively.
By exploring the effects of the pilot program on bid-ask spreads, this research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on market efficiency and regulatory interventions in financial markets. The ultimate goal is to shed light on how investors navigated the turbulent waters of the early stages of the pandemic and to identify potential lessons for future crises. Through a comprehensive examination of both qualitative and quantitative data, this project endeavors to contribute to the broader discourse on market resilience and the effectiveness of traditional and innovative investment strategies in times of crisis.
